# Abduction

> Aliens are abducting humans and running sick games. Humans are fighting to their death in space in brutal heart-renching games... want to see one?

Abduction is a text based story simulator for survival-games-esque matches featuring a revolving cast of simulated agent players.
Follow your favourite players as they battle to escape the alien system.

## How will this work?

Abduction is still work in progress. When the first season launches you can expect:

- Procedural text-based stories for each player
- A rotating cast of humans that are changed by every match
- Shocking unexpected world events, weather and twists
- A human story that focuses on making friends and persevering just as much as violence and depravity
- Tools for browsing and inspecting each player, so you can make an informed decision on who gets your favour
- Site-wide voting to provide advantages (at a cost) to certain players

The schedule is still a bit wip, but here's what I'm thinking so far
- Each season will run for about a month
- Pool of about 100 players, with ~15 in each match
- Games starting every few hours, about 2-3 a day


## Work In Progress

Here's my ideation / notes on current game progress.

-----

New Motivators
 - **Empathy**
  - Comfort a sad person
  - Help a hurt person
  - Grieve for corpse
 - **Exploration**
  - Search for something
    - Water, Food etc
    - % chance to find it or something else
 - **Aggression**
  - If dislike something suitably enough, attack it
 - **Planning?**
  - Pick up resources
  - Establish ally
  - Ask people for memories
 - **Disease**
  - Slowly converts into sickness
  - Can spread to others

Agent Mechanics
 - Focus
   - override default action mechanism for a duration
   - e.g sleeping, talking, fishing, travelling
   - represent actions that take multiple ticks
   - slowly drains "Focus" motivator
     - limit consecutive focuses
   - can involve other entities
     - probably initiated using a side effect?
 - Memories
   - Type of relation that assigns tags to another entity
   - Can be shared w/ other entities
   - Used as references when resolving other actions
   - May not be true i.e can be a rumour
   - e.g
     - Good water source location
     - Person who has infectious disease

Agent Persistence
 - Want a way for the same "players" to appear in multiple games
 - Audience can get attached to their favourite characters
 - Death should still be a way of being eliminated
   - And it should be possible to be completely eliminated
 - IDEA:
   - There is some "entity" that wonders the map and collects corpses
   - Collected corpses are revived into the next game
   - Players with corpses that are not collected are lost forever
     - If they are disintegrated, eaten, exploded etc
     - If something happens to the collector?


Fun Misc Feature Ideas
- Forming Allies
- Owning Pets
- Collecting and Holding Resources
- Players greeting each other
- Memories
- Fire spreading

Websocket Updates
- Resuming websocket when dead
- Backport this to qubit

Migration Safety
- When we make certain changes, I want to update some kind of version tag and then force a new game to be deployed when the CI build runs
- this could quite literally use the rust version and put something in the db

Game linking design
  - Do we have one huge week-long game? or roughly one game a day?
  - I think im leaning towards one game a day, with the expectation that they'll take most of the day
    - Gives more opportunities to see the start of the game, and down-time between games
